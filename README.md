# Weather-Web-Application
This project is a Interactive Weather Web App built with Java, Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JS. It fetches real-time weather using the OpenWeather API and shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. Weather data is stored in PostgreSQL using JDBC, with a page to view and delete saved records.
